# Home Assistant Blueprints
In early 2022 I started to play with Home Assistant to give myself more control over my home's smart devices. I used this as an opportunity to explore what you can do with Home Assistant. The following are the automations and scripts I have turned into blueprints so far. 



| Name | Type | Integration Link | Details |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| Play Media | Script | [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTalvish%2Fhome-assistant-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fscript%2Fplay_media.yaml) | Plays the specified media with shuffle, repeat and volume options. If you have a multi-room setup (e.g. Sonos) additional media players can be specified. The script will place all players into a group. There are no inputs for this blueprint. |
| Play Random Media | Script| [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTalvish%2Fhome-assistant-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fscript%2Fplay_random_media.yaml) | This is the same as `Play Media` except you can specify a list of media content ids that the script will randomly choose from whenever the script is invoked.  |
| Automatic Turning Off | Automation | [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTalvish%2Fhome-assistant-blueprints%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fautomation%2Ftimed_turn_off.yaml) | Automatically turns off the specified switch after a given time period whenever the specified switch is turned on. This was my equivalent of `hello world` to figure out how to create blueprints. |
